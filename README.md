# üßÆ Excel Formulas to Python Equivalents

This repository provides a **complete collection of Excel formulas** ‚Äî translated into **Python equivalents** for data analysis, automation, and financial modeling.  
It also includes **financial functions** such as **NPV**, **Profitability Index (PI)**, **IRR**, and **Payback Period**.

## üìò Project Overview

Excel functions are powerful, but integrating them directly into Python workflows (using `pandas`, `numpy`, or pure logic) enables automation and reproducibility.

This project serves as a **reference guide** and **Python toolkit** for:
- Data analysts transitioning from Excel to Python  
- Finance professionals building automation pipelines  
- Power BI / Data Science teams standardizing Excel logic in Python
